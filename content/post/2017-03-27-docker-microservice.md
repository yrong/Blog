# Build a NodeJS microservice and deploy it to Docker

### Stack
Weâ€™ll use a simple NodeJS service with a MongoDB for our backend.

- NodeJS 7.5.0
- MongoDB 3.4.2
- Docker for Mac 1.13.0

### Architecture

### Microservices

- [Cinema Catalog Service example](https://github.com/yrong/cinema-microservice/blob/master/cinema-catalog-service)
- [Booking Service example](https://github.com/yrong/cinema-microservice/blob/master/booking-service)
- [Payment Service example](https://github.com/yrong/cinema-microservice/blob/master/payment-service)
- [Notification Service example](https://github.com/yrong/cinema-microservice/blob/master/notification-service)
- [API Gateway Service example](https://github.com/yrong/cinema-microservice/blob/master/api-gateway)

### Api Gateway

> An API Gateway is a server that is the single entry point into the system. It is similar to the Facade pattern from object oriented design.

The API Gateway encapsulates the internal system architecture and provides an API that is tailored to each client. It might have other responsibilities such as authentication, monitoring, load balancing, caching, request shaping and management, and static response handling.
