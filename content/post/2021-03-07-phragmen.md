title: Phragmen election
---

The problem that Phragmén’s methods try to solve is that of electing a set of a given numbers of persons from a larger set of candidates. Phragmén discussed this in the context of a parliamentary election in a multi-member constituency; the same problem can, of course, also occur in local elections, but also in many other situations such as electing a board or a committee in an organization.

# Optimizations

* To reduce the number of edges, i.e. to minimize the number of validators any nominator selects
* To ensure, as much as possible, an even distribution of stake among the validators
* Reduce the amount of block computation time
