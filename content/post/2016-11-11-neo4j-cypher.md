### filter element

#### Delete specific element from array

[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31953794/delete-specific-element-from-array)

```
MATCH (n)
WHERE HAS(n.some_array)
SET n.array = FILTER(x IN n.some_array WHERE x <> "oranges");
```

#### split unrelated queries

[case](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21778435/multiple-unrelated-queries-in-neo4j-cypher#comment54304565_21810903)

```
MATCH (a {cond:'1'}), (b {cond:'x'}) CREATE a-[:rel]->b
WITH 1 as dummy
MATCH (a {cond:'2'}), (b {cond:'y'}) CREATE a-[:rel]->b
WITH 1 as dummy
MATCH (a {cond:'3'}), (b {cond:'z'}) CREATE a-[:rel]->b
```

### aggregation

>	remember that anything which isnâ€™t an aggregate function(count/collect/distinct/sum..)  
	is automaticlly used as part of the grouping key which means we could include more than  
	one field in our grouping key.

[neo4j](http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/clauses/aggregation/)

<pre>
MATCH (n { name: 'A' })-[r]->()
RETURN <b>type(r)</b>, count(*)//group key as type(r)
</pre>

<pre>
START player = node:players('name:*')
MATCH player-[:sent_off_in]-game-[:in_month]-month
RETURN COUNT(player.name) AS numberOfReds, <b>month.name</b>//group key as month.name
ORDER BY numberOfReds DESC

### collecting elments

[Neo4j Gist](http://gist.neo4j.org/?4c4ed4fef33bcf5c4b35)

```
MATCH 
    (brand:Brand)-[:CREATED_A]->(campaign:Campaign)<-->(node)
WITH 
    brand, 
    { 
        campaign : campaign, 
        nodes : COLLECT(node)
    } AS campaigns
WITH 
    { 
        brand : brand, 
        campaigns : COLLECT(campaigns)
    } AS brands
RETURN brands
```

```
match (n:Label)
//group by n.prop implicitly
with n.prop as prop, collect(n) as nodelist, count(*) as count
where count > 1
return prop, nodelist, count;
```

[markhneedham](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2014/09/26/neo4j-collecting-multiple-values-too-many-parameters-for-function-collect/)

RETURN p, COLLECT({eventName: e.name, eventTimestamp: e.timestamp});
```

[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30266193/neo4j-cypher-how-to-count-multiple-property-values-with-cypher-efficiently-and)

### null handling

#### case&&null check

[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24487418/cypher-remove-all-properties-with-a-particular-value)

```
load csv with headers from "" as line
with line, case line.foo when '' then null else line.foo end as foo
create (:User {name:line.name, foo:foo})
```

```
MATCH (n:Asset)
WHERE n.manageIP IS NOT NULL
WITH n.manageIP as ips,n as asset
REMOVE asset.manageIP
return asset,ips
```

#### foreach check
[markhneedham](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2014/08/22/neo4j-load-csv-handling-empty-columns/)

```
load csv with headers from "file:/tmp/foo.csv" as row
MERGE (p:Person {a: row.a})
FOREACH(ignoreMe IN CASE WHEN trim(row.b) <> "" THEN [1] ELSE [] END | SET p.b = row.b)
FOREACH(ignoreMe IN CASE WHEN trim(row.c) <> "" THEN [1] ELSE [] END | SET p.c = row.c)
RETURN p
```

[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27576427/cypher-neo4j-case-expression-with-merge)

```
FOREACH ( i in (CASE WHEN {asset_location} IS NOT NULL and {asset_location}.status = 'mounted' THEN [1] ELSE [] END) |
   MERGE (cabinet:Cabinet {uuid:{asset_location}.cabinet})
   MERGE (n)-[:LOCATED{status:"mounted",u:{asset_location}.u,date_mounted:{asset_location}.date_mounted}]->(cabinet)
)
```
